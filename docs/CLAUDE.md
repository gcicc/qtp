## Understanding Financial Charts and Data

### Candlestick Chart Interpretation

Candlestick charts provide four key price points for each time period:
- **Open**: Starting price for the period
- **High**: Highest price reached during the period
- **Low**: Lowest price reached during the period
- **Close**: Ending price for the period

#### Candlestick Anatomy
```
    |  <- Upper Shadow (Wick)
    |
  ┌───┐  <- Real Body
  │   │
  │   │
  └───┘
    |
    |  <- Lower Shadow (Wick)
```

#### Bullish vs Bearish Candles
- **Bullish (Green/White)**: Close > Open, indicating upward price movement
- **Bearish (Red/Black)**: Close < Open, indicating downward price movement

#### Key Candlestick Patterns

**Single Candle Patterns:**
- **Doji**: Open ≈ Close, indicates indecision
- **Hammer**: Small body, long lower shadow, potential bullish reversal
- **Shooting Star**: Small body, long upper shadow, potential bearish reversal
- **Marubozu**: No shadows, strong directional movement

**Multi-Candle Patterns:**
- **Engulfing**: Second candle completely engulfs the first, reversal signal
- **Morning/Evening Star**: Three-candle reversal patterns
- **Three White Soldiers/Black Crows**: Strong continuation patterns

### Volume Analysis
Volume should be analyzed alongside price movement:
- **Volume Confirmation**: Price moves with increasing volume are more reliable
- **Volume Divergence**: Price moves without volume support may be weak
- **Volume Spikes**: Unusual volume often precedes significant price movements

### Chart Timeframes
- **Intraday**: 1-minute to 4-hour charts for short-term trading
- **Daily**: Most common timeframe for swing trading
- **Weekly/Monthly**: Long-term trend analysis and position trading

### Technical Indicators on Charts
- **Trend Indicators**: Moving averages, trendlines, Ichimoku Cloud
- **Momentum Indicators**: RSI, Stochastic, MACD histogram
- **Volatility Indicators**: Bollinger Bands, Average True Range (ATR)
- **Volume Indicators**: On-Balance Volume (OBV), Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
