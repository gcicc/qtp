Position Sizing Algorithms

Implements various position sizing methodologies to optimize risk-adjusted returns
and manage portfolio risk exposure.

Available Algorithms:
- Kelly Criterion: Optimal position sizing based on expected returns and win rate
- Risk Parity: Equal risk contribution across positions  
- Fixed Fractional: Simple percentage-based position sizing
- Volatility Targeting: Position sizes based on volatility normalization
- Maximum Diversification: Position sizing to maximize portfolio diversification
